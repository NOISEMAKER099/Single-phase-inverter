# Single Phase DC–AC Inverter – Internship Project

This repository documents the **system-level design and working principles**
of a **Single-Phase DC–AC Inverter** developed during my R&D internship.

All content in this repository is **non-confidential, conceptual, and learning-based**.
No proprietary schematics, firmware, PCB layouts, or company documents are included.
