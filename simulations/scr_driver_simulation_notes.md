# SCR Driver Simulation Notes

This document summarizes the purpose of simulating
SCR driver circuits during the design phase.

## Why SCR Driver Simulation is Important
- To verify correct gate pulse width
- To ensure sufficient gate current triggering
- To observe pulse timing with respect to control logic
- To validate isolation and gate shaping behavior

## Simulation Approach
- Driver behavior observed using a virtual oscilloscope
- Focus on waveform shape rather than absolute values
- Ensures reliable SCR turn-on during controlled rectification

## Outcome
Simulation helps reduce hardware trial-and-error
and improves confidence before physical testing.
