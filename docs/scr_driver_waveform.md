# SCR Driver – Gate Pulse Observation (Proteus)

This document explains the **observed gate pulse waveform**
from a Proteus virtual oscilloscope during SCR driver testing.

The waveform is used to verify correct triggering behavior
and gate pulse integrity.

## Purpose of SCR Gate Pulse

An SCR requires:
- Sufficient gate current
- Proper pulse width
- Correct timing with respect to AC waveform

The gate pulse ensures reliable turn-on of the SCR
during controlled rectification.

---

## Observed Waveform

The oscilloscope waveform shows:
- A clean gate trigger pulse
- Adequate pulse width for SCR triggering
- Stable pulse shape without distortion

This confirms proper:
- Isolation
- Gate shaping
- Driver functionality

---

## Key Observations

- Gate pulse is clearly distinguishable from noise
- Pulse timing aligns with control signal
- Suitable for consistent SCR triggering

---

## Notes

This waveform is from a **conceptual test setup**
used to understand SCR driver behavior.
No proprietary design values are included.
