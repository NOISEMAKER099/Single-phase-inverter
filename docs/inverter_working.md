# Working Principle – Single Phase DC–AC Inverter

This document explains the working principle of the
single-phase DC–AC inverter at a system level.
The explanation is conceptual and non-confidential.

## DC Bus Formation

The inverter operates from a regulated DC bus.
This DC bus is derived from either:
- AC input through controlled rectification, or
- Wide-range DC input after conditioning

The DC bus provides the required energy for inverter operation.

## PWM Control Strategy

The inverter uses Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to
control the output AC waveform.

- PWM signals are generated by the control unit (MCRI)
- Duty cycle variation controls the effective output voltage
- Switching frequency is chosen to balance efficiency and losses

---

## IGBT Switching Stage

The inverter consists of IGBT-based bridge legs.

- High-side and low-side IGBTs are driven using isolated gate drivers
- Proper dead-time is ensured to avoid shoot-through
- Gate pulses are level-shifted and isolated before application

---

## AC Output Generation

By switching the IGBTs in a controlled PWM sequence:
- The DC bus is converted into an AC waveform
- The output voltage and frequency are controlled electronically
- Filtering may be applied depending on load requirements

---

## Feedback and Protection

The system monitors:
- Output voltage
- Load current

Feedback is used for:
- Regulation
- Protection against abnormal conditions

---

## Design Considerations

- Electrical isolation between control and power stages
- Safe gate driving of power devices
- Thermal and protection awareness
- Modular design for easier debugging and maintenance
